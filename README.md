# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
This repository contains implementation of the basic reinforcement learning algorithms in python, as explained by Sutton and Barto in their book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction. All the python files along with relevant results have been uploaded in the repo.

## Algorithms Implemented
This repo looks at solving different environments using 3 different algorithms :-
  #### 1. First Time Monte Carlo Policy Iteration 
  #### 2. SARSA(0) Control
  #### 3. Q-learning Control
As these are basic algorithms, so testing environments with small observation space and small action space were used, so that these can be implemented through table lookups and complex value function approximators are not required.

## Environments
The environments on which these algorithms were tested :-
  #### 1. BlackJack 
  #### 2. Windy GridWorld
  #### 3. Cliff Walking
More details about the various environments have been given in their respective folders.
